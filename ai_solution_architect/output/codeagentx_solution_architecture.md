# Solution Architecture

## Approach
Leverage a multi-role, multi-agent architecture using CrewAI (for lean customizability and orchestration) or MetaGPT (to simulate a software engineering team) to build an AI coding agent that can write, debug, and explain code. Each agent specializes in a role (e.g., Code Writer, Debugger, Explainer), optionally using context from the codebase (via embeddings or repo tools). Agents interact and hand off tasks, with a conductor managing the workflow and validating results. LLMs such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek2.5, Mistral Large, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet perform code reasoning. Prompt engineering (overview-first, chain-of-thought, role/meta prompting) ensures superior output for code writing, debugging, and explanation.

## Design Patterns
1. Agentic Orchestration (Conductor/Coordinator pattern)
2. Role-based Agent pattern (Writer/Debugger/Explainer)
3. Chain of Responsibility (task handoffs between agents)
4. Tool-augmented Agent (repo and context tools)
5. Prompt Composition and Meta Prompting for LLM robustness

## LLM, SDKs, Tools, Frameworks
- LLMs: GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic), DeepSeek 2.5, Mistral Large
- Frameworks: CrewAI (https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), MetaGPT (https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT)
- Embedding and vector stores: OpenAI Embedding API, FAISS, Chroma
- Repo tooling: GitPython, LangChain tools (if needed), CrewAI's repo manager
- Optional UI: CrewAI Studio GUI, Streamlit, VSCode extension framework
- Evaluation & trace: LangSmith, PromptLayer

## Detailed Design
1. Specify system requirements (code languages to support, scale, error handling).
2. Choose CrewAI or MetaGPT as base framework depending on required complexity/team simulation.
3. Define agents: Code Writer, Debugger, Explainer. Optionally: Reviewer, Tester.
4. Set up orchestration logic (Conductor agent guides flow, error recovery, user interaction).
5. Integrate LLM APIs (choose and allow switching between LLMs for performance/cost).
6. Implement embedding/context tool (for code explanation, search, cross-file reasoning).
7. Create prompt templates: Chain-of-thought for explanations, meta-prompting for ambiguous tasks, role/formatting prompts for each agent.
8. Build repo/issue tool integrations (to clone, read, write, and manage code as required).
9. Implement result validation logic (test case running, static analysis, etc).
10. Package as CLI, hosted API, or GUI (CrewAI Studio/Streamlit or similar).
11. Develop logging, trace, and prompt evaluation support (LangSmith, PromptLayer).
12. Add extensibility for custom tools and third-party API integration.

## Prompting Technique
- Overview-First Prompting for code explanations: Ask for summary first (what is this, what are its parts), then deep dive.
- Chain-of-Thought for debugging: Ask the LLM to reason about possible errors step by step.
- Role Prompting: Specify the role ('You are a senior Python engineerâ€¦') for each agent.
- One-Shot / Meta Prompting: Provide representative example or meta-prompts for tasks needing extra control.
- Tool-augmented prompts: Provide structured input (function signature, code context, error logs) when calling LLM.
- Prompt composition (prefixes, suffixes) to assemble robust multi-stage prompts.
