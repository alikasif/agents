# AI Solution Architect Agent

## Overview

This project leverages agentic AI to build a Solution Architect Agent. The agent is designed to assist users in architecting solutions for complex problem statements using AI, LLMs, and agent-based systems.

## What It Does

- Accepts a problem statement to be solved using AI, LLMs, and agents.
- Suggests the best and latest approach to solve the problem.
- Generates architecture diagrams and design patterns.
- Discusses trade-offs and alternatives.
- Asks clarifying questions to refine requirements.
- Recommends SDKs, frameworks, and tools to use.
- Returns a detailed design, step-by-step implementation plan, and tech stack.
- Suggests the most suitable LLMs for the solution.

## How It Works

The Solution Architect Agent uses advanced LLMs and agentic reasoning to analyze the problem statement, interact with the user for clarification, and synthesize a comprehensive solution architecture. It combines knowledge of AI design patterns, current technologies, and best practices to deliver actionable guidance.

## Key Features

- Interactive problem analysis and clarification
- Automated architecture and design generation
- Trade-off analysis and recommendations
- SDK and tech stack suggestions
- Step-by-step solution blueprint
- LLM selection guidance

## Technologies Used

- Agentic AI frameworks
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- AutoGen Agent SDK (or similar)
- Integration with architecture and design tools

## Example Use Case

1. User submits a business problem statement.
2. Agent asks clarifying questions if needed.
3. Agent proposes a solution architecture and design.
4. Agent lists trade-offs and alternatives.
5. Agent recommends SDKs, tech stack, and LLMs.
6. Agent provides a step-by-step implementation plan.
