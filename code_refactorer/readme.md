# Code Refactoror Agent

## Overview

The Code Refactoror Agent is an intelligent automation tool designed to:
- Refactor source code for improved readability, maintainability, and performance
- Refactor and update test cases to match code changes
- Refactor and enhance documentation
- Automatically run the refactored code against the test suite to ensure correctness

This agent leverages LLM-based reasoning and code analysis to provide high-quality, production-ready code transformations.

## Features
- **Automated Code Refactoring:** Cleans up and optimizes code while preserving functionality
- **Test Case Refactoring:** Updates and improves test cases to align with refactored code
- **Documentation Refactoring:** Enhances and updates documentation for clarity and accuracy
- **Automated Testing:** Runs the refactored code against the test suite to verify correctness
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Ensures that code, tests, and docs are always in sync

## Usage

1. **Place your codebase in the appropriate directory.**
2. **Configure the agent** with your desired refactoring goals and constraints (see configuration options).
3. **Run the agent** to perform refactoring and validation:
   - The agent will refactor code, tests, and docs
   - It will then execute the test suite
   - Results and a summary report will be provided

## Example Workflow

1. The agent analyzes the codebase and identifies refactoring opportunities.
2. It applies code transformations and updates related test cases and documentation.
3. The agent runs the test suite (e.g., using `pytest` or another test runner).
4. If all tests pass, the refactored code is ready for review or deployment.
5. If tests fail, the agent provides diagnostics and suggestions for further improvement.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- LLM API access (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- Test runner (e.g., pytest, unittest)
- Any additional dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`

## Extensibility
- The agent can be extended to support additional languages, frameworks, or custom refactoring rules.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous code quality improvement.

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended to assist developers and should be used with code review and validation. Always review refactored code before deploying to production.
