# Software Team: Autonomous Code Generation and Review Platform

This project is an agentic, AI-driven platform that automates the software development workflow—from code generation to code review and GitHub integration—based on user input.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** To automate the process of generating code, adding test cases, performing code reviews, and integrating approved code into a GitHub repository using a team of AI/agentic agents.
- **Agents & LLMs Used:**
  - **Developer Agent (Anthropic LLM):** Uses Anthropic's LLM to generate code based on user requirements, add test cases, and fix code review comments before resubmitting for review.
  - **Code Review Agent (OpenAI LLM):** Uses OpenAI's LLM to review the code and test cases, providing feedback and comments.
  - **Tester Agent:** Executes the generated programs under `generated/{project_name}/` and runs unit tests to validate that the code works correctly.
  - **GitHub Integration Agent (Gemini):** Uses Gemini to commit and push the code to the repository if approved by the code review agent. The commit message is auto-generated based on the changes in the commit.

## Workflow

1. **User Input:** The user provides a description of the desired functionality or feature.
2. **Code Generation & Test Case Addition:** The Developer Agent (Anthropic LLM) creates the initial code, adds appropriate test cases, and places them in the `software-team/generated/` folder.
3. **Testing:** The Tester Agent executes the generated program and runs unit tests to validate functionality.
4. **Code Review:** The Code Review Agent (OpenAI LLM) reviews the code and test cases, leaving comments if improvements are needed.
5. **Fixes & Resubmission:** The Developer Agent (Anthropic LLM) addresses the review comments and resubmits the code for another review cycle.
6. **Approval & Commit:** If the Code Review Agent approves the code, the GitHub Integration Agent (Gemini) commits and pushes the code to the repository. The commit message is automatically generated based on the changes.

## Directory Structure

- `software-team/generated/` — All code and test cases generated by the agents are always placed here.
- `software-team/generated/{project_name}/` — Each project gets its own subfolder with modular code files.
- `software-team/generated/{project_name}/tests/` — Unit tests for each project are stored here.
- Other folders/files — For agent logic, configuration, and orchestration scripts.

## Extensibility

- The platform is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing integration with various AI and agentic SDKs (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain, HuggingFace, etc.).
- Agents can be enhanced or replaced to support new workflows, review standards, or code generation techniques.

## How to Use

1. **Provide a Feature Request:**
   - Describe the functionality you want to implement.
2. **Run the Agentic Workflow:**
   - The system will automatically generate code, add tests, execute and test the code, review, fix, and commit as described above.
3. **Check the `software-team/generated/` Folder:**
   - All generated code and tests will appear here, and approved code will be committed to the repository.

## Testing Capabilities

The Tester Agent provides comprehensive validation:
- **Program Execution:** Runs the generated `main.py` file and captures output/errors
- **Unit Test Execution:** Uses Python's unittest discovery to run all test files
- **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error reporting and timeout protection
- **Validation:** Ensures generated code is actually executable and functional

## Notes
- The project aims to demonstrate a fully autonomous, agent-driven software development workflow.
- All code review and approval is performed by AI/agentic agents, with no human intervention required.
- The system can be extended to support additional review steps, CI/CD integration, or other team roles.
- Commit messages are automatically generated by the Gemini agent based on the actual changes in the commit for clarity and traceability.
- The Tester Agent ensures that generated code is not only syntactically correct but also functionally working.
