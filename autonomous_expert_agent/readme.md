# Autonomous Expert Agent Framework

## Overview

This project aims to build an advanced autonomous agent capable of handling complex tasks with expert-level depth. Unlike traditional agents that perform shallow operations, this agent plans multi-step processes, delegates execution to specialized sub-agents, incorporates customizable system prompts, and utilizes filesystem tools for task organization, tracking, and persistence. The framework is designed to simulate human-like expertise in task decomposition, execution, and management.

## Key Features

- **Task Planning**: The main agent analyzes a given task and breaks it down into detailed, sequential steps.
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: Specialized sub-agents handle individual steps or subtasks, allowing for modular and scalable execution.
- **System Prompts**: Configurable prompts guide the agent's behavior, ensuring alignment with specific domains or expertise levels.
- **Filesystem Integration**: Tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files to maintain task logs, progress trackers, and data artifacts.
- **Expert-Level Depth**: Emphasizes thorough reasoning, error handling, and iterative refinement over superficial task completion.
- **Modularity**: Easily extendable with new sub-agents or tools for diverse applications.

## Architecture

The system is structured around a central "orchestrator" agent that coordinates the workflow:

1. **Input Reception**: Receive a task description from the user.
2. **Planning Phase**: Use reasoning to decompose the task into actionable steps.
3. **Delegation**: Assign steps to sub-agents, each equipped with relevant tools or prompts.
4. **Execution and Tracking**: Sub-agents perform actions, updating files for state management (e.g., task logs in JSON or Markdown format).
5. **Feedback Loop**: The orchestrator reviews outputs, iterates if needed, and compiles final results.
6. **Persistence**: All intermediate data is stored in files for traceability and resumption.

Example Workflow:
- Task: "Research and summarize recent AI advancements."
- Plan: Step 1: Search sources; Step 2: Analyze data; Step 3: Generate summary.
- Sub-Agents: Research Agent (web search tool), Analysis Agent (data processing), Writer Agent (text generation).
- Files: `task_plan.json`, `research_notes.md`, `progress_log.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous_expert_agent.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (assuming Python-based implementation):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: Requirements may include libraries like `langchain`, `openai`, or custom toolkits for filesystem operations.*

3. Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys for external services if needed).

## Usage

1. Configure the system prompt in `config/system_prompt.txt`.
2. Run the orchestrator:
   ```
   python main.py --task "Your task description here"
   ```
3. Monitor output in the console and generated files in the `workspace/` directory.

Example:
```
python main.py --task "Build a simple web scraper and save results to a file."
```

The agent will plan, execute via sub-agents, and track progress in files.
