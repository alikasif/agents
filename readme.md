# AgenticAI: AI Practitioners' Experimental Repository

Welcome to AgenticAI, a collaborative repository for AI practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts to experiment, learn, and teach about AI and agentic systems. This project is designed to foster hands-on exploration of modern AI techniques, agent architectures, and practical applications.

## Project Overview

AgenticAI provides a modular environment for building, testing, and demonstrating:
- Autonomous agents
- RESTful APIs and clients
- Data-driven chatbots
- Prompt engineering tools
- Code refactoring utilities
- Multi-agent orchestration

The repository is organized into folders for different agentic and AI use cases, including:
- `ai_stock_agent`: Financial analysis and stock screening agents
- `api_chatbot`: API specification, server, and REST client for dog store
- `code_refactorer`: Code refactoring tools
- `data_chatbot`: SQL generation and database metadata agents
- `prompt_generator`: Prompt generation and judging agents
- `software_team`: Multi-agent system for code review, development, and testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alikasif/agents.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the folders and run the example scripts to learn about agentic systems and AI workflows.
