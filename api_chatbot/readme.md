# API Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project aims to build an agent that enables end-users to call APIs using natural language. The agent will take user input and API specifications, pass them to a Large Language Model (LLM), and generate endpoints that can be called using a REST client tool integrated with the agent.

## Features

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for user input
* API specification parsing and processing
* LLM-based endpoint generation
* Integration with REST client tool
