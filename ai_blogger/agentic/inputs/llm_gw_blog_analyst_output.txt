The Rise of the LLM Inference Gateway' sub_topics=['Definition of LLM Inference Gateway', "The 'Fragmentation' Problem: Multiple API Standards", 'Vendor Lock-in Risks', 'Operational Challenges: Cost, Latency, and Reliability'] content='An introduction to the concept of an Inference Gateway (IGW) for Large Language Models. This section will define what an IGW is—a middleware layer that unifies access to disparate LLM providers. It will explore the primary challenges that necessitate such a tool, including the fragmentation of API formats (OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. Local), the risk of vendor lock-in, unpredictable operational costs, and the need for high availability. It will effectively map these challenges to the specific solutions an IGW provides, such as a Universal API, fallback routing, and centralized budget controls.'

This section will provide a concrete example, likely using LiteLLM due to its popularity and simplicity, to demonstrate how to configure a 'Universal API' that routes to multiple providers with fallback logic. It will includes code snippets for a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that sets up OpenAI as primary and Azure/Anthropic as fallbacks."
