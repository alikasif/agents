Improvements beyond Naive or Frozen RAG

1. Routing the query to the most relevant datasource
2. Retrieving from multiple sources
3. Retreival grading to select only the relevant documents from single or multiple datasources
4. Query re-writing for better retreival
5. Breaking complex query into multiple queries, retreive and rank across them
6. grading the response for relevancy and hallucinations
7. Hybrid search. Combines keyword-based search (like BM25) with semantic vector search to leverage the strengths of both approaches. 
8. Agentic RAG with multi step reasoning, planing and information retreival
9. Use LLm as a judge pattern to self critic and re-retreive for more relevant answers

Few of the Advance RAG techniques

1. HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) RAG
2. HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings) RAG
2. Embedding free RAG
3. Order preserving RAG (OP-RAG)
4. RAG2.0
